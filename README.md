Common Terminology in Software Development

**Repository (Repo)** - The location where all files for a particular project are stored. Repositories can be created locally or online.

**Fork** - Creating a personal copy of someone else’s online repo(project).

**Clone** - Making a copy of an online repo into your local computer. This repo will be stored on your computer instead of on a website’s server.

**Pull Requests** - When you fork and clone a repo, make an update to the project and want to be recognized by the original developer you can create a pull request so that they original author of the repository can see your changes and decide whether or not to accept those changes into the official project.

**Git** - A version control system created by Linus Torvalds that allows you to manage changes to your project and allows for easy collaboration with other developers. Git allows developers to track every change to their programs in the event that they ever have to go back and restore it’s original code. See git commands here. Practice git commands here.

**Text Editor** - A system or program that allows a user to edit text.

**Fuzzy Search** - Very similar to autocomplete. It is a process that locates Web pages that are likely to be relevant to a search argument even when the argument does not exactly correspond to the desired information.

**Bug** - A coding error in a computer program.


**Debugging** - The process of locating and fixing or bypassing bugs(errors) in a computer program code or the engineering of a hardware device.

**Development Environment (Dev Environment)** - The set of processes and programming tools used to create a program or software product.

**Open Source** - Describes a program whose source code is made available for use or modification by users or other developers as they see fit.

**Algorithm** - A set of logical or mathematical procedures to solve a problem.

**Function** - A set of instructions which are written once to obtain a particular result, and can then be used whenever necessary by “calling” it.

**Iteration** - A sequence of instructions which are repeated. For example, to perform an action for every item in a list you would “iterate” over that list. Each time it is repeated  is one iteration.

**GUI** - General (Graphical?) User Interface, refers to a piece of software which the end user actually sees and interacts with.

**JSON** - A format for transmitting information between locations which is based on JavaScript. Many APIs use JSON. It’s a JavaScript object readable by the browser. 

**Logical Operation** - The use of simple Boolean logical such as and, or, and not. 

**Loop** - A piece of code which keeps running until a certain condition is fulfilled or isn't fulfilled in the case of an “infinite loop” which will crash the system running it.

**Markup Language** - A relatively simple language used to format pages, such as HTML.

**Variable** - A way to store a piece of data which can then be modified at any time.
 
**Boolean** - A binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false”.

**Syntax** - Rules of language.

**Terminal** - An interface in which you can type and execute text based commands.

**Shell** - Command line interpreter. It is the primary interface that users see when they log in, whose primary purpose is to start other programs.

**Console** - Physical terminal.

**Command** - Refers to an instruction to a computer or device to perform a specific task. Every program that interacts with people responds to a specific set of commands. The set of commands and the syntax for entering them is called the user interface. Commonly a command is a directive to some kind of command line interface, such as a command interpreter. Commands come in different forms such as: 1) special words (keywords) that a program understands 2) function keys 3) choices in a menu 4) buttons or other graphical objects on your screen.

**HTML Attributes** - HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about the element. Attributes are specified in a start tag.

**HTML** - Hypertext Markup
