*Common Terminology in JavaScript Software Development*

**Repository (Repo)** - The location where all files for a particular project are stored. Repositories can be created locally or online.

**Fork** - Creating a personal copy of someone else’s online repo(project).

**Clone** - Making a copy of an online repo into your local computer. This repo will be stored on your computer instead of on a website’s server.

**Pull Requests** - When you fork and clone a repo, make an update to the project and want to be recognized by the original developer you can create a pull request so that they original author of the repository can see your changes and decide whether or not to accept those changes into the official project.

**Git** - A version control system created by Linus Torvalds that allows you to manage changes to your project and allows for easy collaboration with other developers. Git allows developers to track every change to their programs in the event that they ever have to go back and restore it’s original code. See git commands here. Practice git commands here.

**Local Repo Vs. Remote Repo** -

**Text Editor** - A system or program that allows a user to edit text.

**Fuzzy Search** - Very similar to autocomplete. It is a process that locates Web pages that are likely to be relevant to a search argument even when the argument does not exactly correspond to the desired information.

**Bug** - A coding error in a computer program.

**Debugging** - The process of locating and fixing or bypassing bugs(errors) in a computer program code or the engineering of a hardware device.

**Development Environment (Dev Environment)** - The set of processes and programming tools used to create a program or software product.

**Open Source** - Describes a program whose source code is made available for use or modification by users or other developers as they see fit.

**Algorithm** - A set of logical or mathematical procedures to solve a problem.

**Function** - A set of instructions which are written once to obtain a particular result, and can then be used whenever necessary by “calling” it or "invoking" it.

**Arguments/Parameters** - The parameters are the aliases for the values that will be passed to the function. The arguments are the actual values.

**Function Signature** -

**Function Return Values** -

**Iteration** - A sequence of instructions which are repeated. For example, to perform an action for every item in a list you would “iterate” over that list. Each time it is repeated  is one iteration.

**GUI** - General (Graphical?) User Interface, refers to a piece of software which the end user actually sees and interacts with.

**JSON** - A format for transmitting information between locations which is based on JavaScript. Many APIs use JSON. It’s a JavaScript object readable by the browser. 

**Logical Operation** - The use of simple Boolean logical such as and, or, and not. 

**Loop** - A piece of code which keeps running until a certain condition is fulfilled or isn't fulfilled in the case of an “infinite loop” which will crash the system running it.

**Markup Language** - A relatively simple language used to format pages, such as HTML.

**Variable** - A way to store a piece of data which can then be modified at any time.
 
**Boolean** - A binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false”.

**Syntax** - Rules of a language.

**Terminal** - An interface in which you can type and execute text based commands.

**Shell** - Command line interpreter. It is the primary interface that users see when they log in, whose primary purpose is to start other programs.

**Console** - Physical terminal.

**Command** - Refers to an instruction to a computer or device to perform a specific task. Every program that interacts with people responds to a specific set of commands. The set of commands and the syntax for entering them is called the user interface. Commonly a command is a directive to some kind of command line interface, such as a command interpreter. Commands come in different forms such as: 1) special words (keywords) that a program understands 2) function keys 3) choices in a menu 4) buttons or other graphical objects on your screen.

**HTML Attributes** - HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about the element. Attributes are specified in a start tag.

**HTML** - Hypertext Markup Language, HTML is the structure of a web site. It is the structure that holds your web content.

**Web Content** - 

**MVP** - A minimum viable product (MVP) is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy basic functionality of requirements.

**Absolute File Path** - Full file path.

**EDP** - The engineering design process(EDP) is a series of steps that engineers follow to come up with a solution to a problem. Many times the solution involves designing a product (like a machine or computer code) that meets certain criteria and/or accomplishes a certain task.

**node** - Server side JavaScript run-time enviorment used to serve up/run js files.

**npm** - Node Package Manager used to install different packages in node, such as live-server.

**Sanity Check** - Checking to see if all files are linked together and working.

**Function** - A piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

**Methods** - A piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:
1. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
2. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

**Rubber Duckie** - The idea of using something, be it a rubber duck, your pet hamster, or the stuffed pink panda bear as a sounding board for working through a problem is not new. It is a method of debugging code by having a developer walk through his code outloud if there's no one else around. 

**Scope** - In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables. Scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.

**Global Vs. Local Variables** - Local variables have local scope: They can only be accessed within the function. A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. 

**Data Types** - JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more.

**Pair Programming** -  When two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

**White Boarding** - When teams use a dry-erase board to draw or see shapes, notes and other visual elements of a plan. For example, a team may use white boarding to draw their wireframes or design for their website MVP.

**Scrum** - Method of frequent quick updates used in project teams to keep projects agile and fluid.

**Control Flow** - The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

**Concatenation** - Is a method of combining strings together using the (+) operator. This method does not change the existing strings, but returns a new string containing the text of the joined strings.

**Anonymous Object** - 

**Key Value Pairs** -

**Multi Demensional Arrays** -

**Events** -

**Framework** -

**Libraries** -

**Browser** -

**Dev Tools** -

**ECMA Script** -

**Vanilla JavaScript** -
